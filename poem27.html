what?
we're gonna be friends
haloperidol makes me
violent and gross

first time
hospital ride

I'm in;I'm out
I've been here 3 weeks

A jumpered dummy spit
x3

& I explain
A nuddie run &
a short ride

ambulance unwanted
psychotic break after an
uneventful morning walk

truth I thought I
was in heaven
heading to a cricket
match

an aftershock
of haloperidol
and a convo

with a vampiress?
(we are gonna be friends)

shit-tested *2

the multi-psychiatrist
special delivery
a history of softness

x 2 shots
& an arse
caressed

naive no
more
