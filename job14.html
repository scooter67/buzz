Mortals, born of woman,
are of few days and full of trouble.
They spring up like flowers and wither away;
like fleeting shadows*, they do not endure.
Do you fix your eyes on them?
Will you bring them before you for judgement?
Who can bring what is prure from the impure?
No one!
A persons days are determined;
you have decreed the number of his months
and have set limits he cannot exceed.
So look away from him and let him alone,
till he has put in his time like a hired laborer.

At least their is hope for a tree:
It is cut down, it will sprout again,
and its new shoots will not fail.
Its roots may grow old in the ground
and its stump die in the soil,
yet at the scent of water it will bud
and put forth shoots like a plant.
But a man dies and is laid low;
he breathes his last and is no more.
As the water of a lake dries up
or a riverbed becomes parched and dry,
so he lies down and does not rise;
till the heavens are no more, people will not
awake or be roused from their sleep.

If only you would hide me in the grave
and conceal me till your anger has passed!
If only you would set me a time 
and then remember me!
If someone dies, will they live again?
All the days of my hard service
I will wait for my renewal to come.
You will call and I will answer you;
you will long for the creature your hands
have made.
Surely then you will count my steps
but not keep track of my sin.

But as a mountain erodes and crubles
and as a rock is moved from his play,
as water wears away stones
and torrents wash away the soil,
so you destroy a person's hope.
You overpower them once for all, 
and they are all gone;
you change their counternance and
send them away.
If their children are honoured,
they do not know it;
If their offspring are brought low,
they do not see it.
They feel but the pain of their own bodies
and mourn only for themselves.
