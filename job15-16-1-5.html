I have head many things like these;
you are miserable conforters, all of you!
Will your long-winded speeches never end?
What ails you that you keep on arguing?
I also could speak like you,
if you were in my place;
I could make fine speeches against you
and shake mey head against you.
But my mouth would encourage you;
confort from my lips would bring your relief.
