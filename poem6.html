Let's drink to eccentric friends
(Someone) wise recently
told me if they told me
the time I'd build them
a clock
(and that I couldn't help it)
I wish I could (actually)
rather than metaphorically
I'd have surely been
elsewhere & elsewhen
clock-building
contentedly

Anciently in my early 17s
someone also said "you're
the first I've met in
Australia" who walks
around with a cloud-full of
ideas in his head

"& I like you"
So I plyed flute
for her wedding
