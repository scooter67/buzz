Right on the local TAFE
Thinking of writing a poem
Why did the apprentices cross the road?
En mass they wait two straggle forwards
having broken ranks floating forward
impatiently light-deniers confidence in
front of an audience of peers a slight
smile of embarrassment on one face
a gentle amused pack waits
is selfcontrol competence?
They cross together
