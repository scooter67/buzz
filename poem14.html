I've got some healing to do
& I bless the ton I have
already done what family
doesn't have illness (we
are humanity) and we all
fall

fallen
fallen
yet we hold on and
the hope that hope
travels down a
fallen line

healing also
in our midst
a cry a hope
through the ages
for we are yet
sons of adam &
daughters of eve
