movements not super-steady
loose assembled one of them
had some fast food A challenge
was flicked out "Yr a pervert
bro" casual familarity clearly
not ment at me

I was walking I felt
the switch go my body
slinky & loose limbed
before a single
heart-beat assertive
& explosive posture
younger

capable of bouncing up after a
skateboard fall an inta-retort from
the gallery I want through
