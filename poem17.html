We got contemptuous of
gender roles must we now
ignore gender differences
if we divest ourselves of
gender responsibilities
will that have the same outcome
of just annihilating our
responsibilities (our rights)
In our charge towards
equality what of
ourselves have we left
behind
"It is written what profit
a man if he gains the whole
world but loses his soul"
what then of our souls?
our gender roles
